# DB_SubstanceAbuseTreatmentClinic
Student Project to design a database for small substance abuse clinic.
Substance Abuse Treatment Center
For our proposed  project  the  clinical IT system used was ideally for  a substance abuse treatment program which included  workflow related to patient intake, assessment, treatment planning, and progress tracking. The  tasks that were  included in these workflows were  as follows :
•Patient intake: This involved collecting basic demographic and contact information from patients, as well as information about their substance abuse history and current symptoms.
•Assessment: This also  involved  evaluating patients to determine their level of substance abuse, the severity of their addiction, and any co-occurring mental health disorders.
•Treatment planning: Based on the assessment, a treatment plan was  developed that outlined the specific goals of treatment and the interventions that would  be used to achieve them.
•Progress tracking: This involved  collecting data on patients' progress during treatment and using it to adjust the treatment plan as needed.
